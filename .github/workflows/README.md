## üîç Automated Testing and GitHub Workflows

To ensure the stability and reliability of our Python game project, we implemented automated testing and GitHub workflows as part of our development process.

### üß™ Purpose of Automated Tests

Automated tests are designed to verify the core gameplay logic ‚Äî such as collision detection, score updates, and game-over conditions. These tests serve two key purposes:

1. **Validate Essential Game Mechanics**  
   We pre-identified critical functions that define how the game operates. By writing tests for these components, we ensure they behave as expected under various conditions.

2. **Prevent Breaking Changes**  
   As team members contribute new features or edits, automated tests run in the background to confirm that existing functionality remains intact. If a change disrupts core logic, the test will fail and alert us before the code is merged.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Role of GitHub Workflows

GitHub workflows automate the process of running tests, linting code, and building documentation. Every time someone pushes code or opens a pull request, the workflow:

- Installs project dependencies
- Runs all test files using `pytest`
- Checks code style with `flake8`
- (Optionally) Builds documentation with Sphinx

This automation ensures that all contributions meet our quality standards and that the game remains functional throughout development.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Confidence in Code Quality**  
  We can merge changes knowing they‚Äôve passed all checks.

- **Efficient Collaboration**  
  Team members don‚Äôt need to manually test each change.

- **Professional Development Practices**  
  Our setup mirrors real-world software engineering workflows.

By integrating automated testing and GitHub workflows, we created a robust and maintainable project that supports teamwork and continuous improvement.
