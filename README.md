# Soft204 Python Final Project: Snake Eater, Snake Smarter
Final group project for SOFT204 class at Bates Technical College. We have modified an existing open-source Snake PyGame, including visual and gameplay changes, as well as refactoring.

Play as a knowledge-hungry snake, searching and gobbling up food as it appears. The more you eat, the more you grow, and the more you grow, the bigger your smarts get! Keep your head up and watch out for walls you might smack into, and make sure to not run into yourself as you grow!

## Changes Made to Original Script
1. The window size was enlarged from 480x720 to 1280x720
2. Sound effects when the snake eats food and crashes into the wall
3. An interactive splash screen that allows the user to select a difficulty level and start the game
4. Session high score tracked, stored, and displayed
5. Replay button added at end screen
6. End screen title changed
7. Floating hats appear when the snake eats food
8. Snake changes color when it eats food
9. Title of the game changed
10. Score is displayed as 'Smarts' instead of 'Score'

## Workflow  
A workflow was added to this repository to run tests to ensure pull requests do not break key game mechanics.
